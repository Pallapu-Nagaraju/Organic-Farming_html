            <h1>India's natural, organic farming strategy for rice and wheat</h1>
            <p>India is predominantly agrarian â€” 80 per cent of the population is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture. Rice and wheat are the staple for 90 per cent of the country's people. Till the early 1960's, the predominant mode of cultivation was what is now called "organic farming", with no synthetic fertilisers or pesticides available or known.</p>

            <h1>Organic Pulse Production: </h1>
            <p>Pulses are an essential part of global human nutrition and sustainable agriculture, consisting of a range of leguminous crops like beans, lentils, and chickpeas. The growing demand for organic food has made organic pulse cultivation a viable means of satisfying this need while also fostering environmental stewardship and strengthening farm resilience. Increased biodiversity on farms, fewer chemical inputs, and better soil health are just a few benefits of growing pulses organically.

            <h1>Organic Vegetable Farming </h1>
            <p>Organic Farming is highly beneficial to farmers as the vegetables produced have high nutritional quality with sufficient quantity. This farming system encourages the biological cycle by using microorganisms, soil flora, and fauna, plants, and animals. It helps to retain the fertility of the soil for longer durations. Organic Vegetable farming is somewhat challenging as it is a risky method for beginners</p>
