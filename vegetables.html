                <p>Organic Farming is highly beneficial to farmers as the vegetables produced have high nutritional quality with sufficient quantity. This farming system encourages the biological cycle by using microorganisms, soil flora, and fauna, plants, and animals. It helps to retain the fertility of the soil for longer durations. Organic Vegetable farming is somewhat challenging as it is a risky method for beginners.</p>

                <h1>Soil requirement and management</h1>
                <img src="https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/ta/org_farm/orgfarm_manure_clip_image002.jpg" class="featured-image2">
        
                <p>Manures, Green sand, Sulfur, Potassium, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Vermicompost, Biofertilers, Boron, Bone meal, Green Manure Crops, etc. are the important components required for the Organic Vegetable. Most of the farmers rely on compost which is well decomposed as a natural fertilizer. Green manure helps to get the nitrogen from atmosphere along with which it increases soil nutrients and helps to store and hold the organic matter and nutrients in the non-growth season. Hence, the soil remains fertile for longer durations. This also helps to prevent diseases and insects Animal Manure adds great advantages to the soil in turn for the field or land. Potash helps to increase the potassium content in soil. Weeds and unwanted plants take advantage to grow rapidly in this farming which harms the vegetable and crops.

                <h1>Soil management techniques</h1>
                <p>Theequipments needed for Organic farming should be natural as the biological process is controlled by microorganisms. The soil management techniques are different as this type of farming does not require any chemical substances
                </p>
                <h1>Planting materials</h1>
                <p>Before planting the materials one should check for the soil management which needs to be perfect enough as the vegetable thrives to grow well in loose fertile soil. To attain this, the soil should be mixed up thoroughly with organic fertilizer. Raised beds are more productive in Organic Vegetable Farming. Beds can be created in any shape by digging the soil 8-10 inches deep and raise the bed 4-6 inches up. This allows roots to grow faster at a depth of 12-16 inches. An important point to be noticed that bed depth depends upon vegetable varieties
                </p>
                <h1>Choosing vegetable varieties based on the climatic conditions
                </h1>
                <p>When you choose Organic Vegetable Farming, the soil will be richly formulated so that you can grow any crop at any season but not in an effective way, it might destroy your production due to ineffective climatic conditions. Hence, it is advisable to choose and cultivate seasonal vegetables. Careful observation is required if the chosen area is influenced by the climate or pests. Get good advice from the local government agricultural office which vegetable types are best suited to grow in the chosen area. Organic Farming is a profitable agricultural method where you can grow any vegetable but here is the vegetable list which has given huge profits and has become popular Organic Vegetables. These include Cabbage, Cauliflower, Broccoli, Peas, Beans, Spinach, Herbs, Lettuce, Corn, Tomatoes, Cherry tomatoes, Okra, Brinjals, Pumpkins, Cucumbers, Watermelons, Carrots, Radishes, Beetroots, Potatoes, and Onions
                </p>
                <h1>Importance of Organic vegetable farming
                </h1>
                <p>In recent studies, it has been proved that many of the diseases and the cattle are recorded due to the usage the harmful chemicals during the conventional cultivation process. Here, Organic Farming gained enormous importance which is produced from the Organic Waste that adds more advantages and improved human immune systems. The vegetable harvested from this Organic Farming showed 50% more Vitamins and nutrients than other methods. It mainly keeps the environment safe and retains soil fertility avoiding soil erosion. Hence, it has a high demand in the market and the farmers choose it as best cultivation method compared to conventional cultivation method.

                <h1>Organic vegetable panting methods
                </h1>
                <p>Organic seeds or seedlings are available in the markets and every vegetable has its individual instructions that are necessary for sowing. There are two types of planting methods in Organic Vegetable Farming
                </p>
                <p>1. Organic Seed planting method-Organic Seeds are inexpensive and are available in various ranges of varieties where you have to raise them inside at least a few weeks. But for some vegetables like Carrots, Spinach, Peas, etc. can be directly sowed in the land When the planting time arrives the seedling has to be planted in the bed.
                </p>
                <p>2. Organic Seedling planting method-This method is not so preferred unless you are a beginner. These seedlings can be directly transferred to the raised beds and have to be little careful while collecting the seedlings. One has to collect these seedlings from an organically certified Nursery</p>
                <h1>How to control weeds organically
                </h1>
                <p>Weeds are the most problematic components in organic cultivation, as these spread unnecessary growth by taking all the nutrients from the organic soil and also create diseases, shelter to the insects, etc. The weeding procedures should be done rapidly for the success of Organic Vegetable Farming. Weeds can be reduced by following many ways such as Biological. Cultural, thermal and Mechanical schemes. But following these methods incurs a lot of work and is costlier. Cultural Weed control process is the most common method followed in Organic Vegetable Farming. These cover crops surpluses the soil which stops weeds growth. Intercropping can also be the best solution. Biological weed control procedures such as Nitrogen eradicates and using irrigation also helps to lessen the growth of weeds by reducing the moisture content to the weeds. Organic wedding tools such as Brush weeders, Summers, Mowers, Hoes, Tines, Harrows are used in weeding.
                </p>
                <h1>Organic pest control
                </h1>
                <p>The best practices to control pests in Organic Vegetable Farming are Building Compost Heavy soil, Disease Immune Vegetable Seeds or plant, Careful Monitoring during vegetable growth stages, Pulling out the affected or weaker area of a plant, Maintaining dry foliage, Sufficient Irrigation during the dry season, Protecting the plants from direct sunlight, Practicing mulching methods, Minimising insect habitat, Applying for Organic Certification.
                </p>
                <h1>Risks Involved in organic vegetable farming
                </h1>
                <p>There are many challenges in Organic Vegetable Farming such as Higher Production costs of Managernent, Labour charges even for lower farm yields. For few farmers, they experienced very little change in the yield but for horticultural crops such as Tree fruits have a markable significant difference in the yield have been observed. The marketing costs are higher but there is less infrastructure for maintaining Organic varieties. At present, demand for Organic Vegetables is more than supply.
                </p>
                <h1>Harvesting procedure of organic vegetables</h1>
                <p>Harvesting Organic Vegetables can be done based on different ways for different varieties of vegetables
                </p>
                <h1>The yield of organic vegetables per acre</h1>
                <p>The yield is high for few varieties of vegetables but sorne vegetables have a very less yield. A minimum of 25% increase in the yield was observed in Organic Vegetable farming compared to conventional cultivation.
                </p>
                <p>Costs involved in Organic Vegetable farming per 1 acre</p>
                <p>Land preparation = Rs. 30,000</p>
                <p>Planting materials = Rs. 20,000</p>
                <p>Manures and Organic fertilizers Rs. 40,000</p>
                <p>Plant protection= Rs. 5,000</p>
                <p>Irrigation Rs. 3,000</p>
                <p>Labour Charges = Rs. 50,000</p>
                <p>Miscellaneous cost = Rs. 3,000</p>
                <p>10% of total cost = Rs. 15100</p>
                <p>Total cost = Rs. 1,66,100</p>
                <h1>Organic vegetable farming Income returns</h1>
                <p>The Farmgateprice per 1 Kg of Organic Vegetables for example Tomatoes cost - Rs. 15 per Kg. The yield will be 20 tons per acre. So income per 1 acre of Organic Tomatoes = 15-20000 Rs. 3,00,000
                </p>
                <p>Profit and Returns from organic vegetable cultivation
                </p>
                <p>Profit Income-Total cost incurred = Rs.3,00,000-Rs.1,66,100 Rs 1,33,900 Hence the profit is Rs.1,33,900 per acre for Organic Tomato Farming. Like this it differences from vegetable to vegetable; area to area and region to region</p>
